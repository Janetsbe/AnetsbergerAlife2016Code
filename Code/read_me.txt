Python and Unity code is written to use mongoDB to store and pass data between programs (twitch
interface and Unity simulation)

Unity assets folder contains all unity components needed. Import folder "Assets" into a unity project 
using Unity 5.3

Twitch Unity Interfacing folder contains python scripts which interface with a twitch channel's 
IRC client and a running unity simulation.

The Data Learning folder contains python scripts used for ANN training and data analysis part
of phase 2.

jumpData.zip contains data set used to train neural network predictive
model (robot data s.t. command = "jump" and |o| > 0) 

Thorough instructions on how to set up a evolutionary robotics simulation similar to
the one used for this research can be found at:
